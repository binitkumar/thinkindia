          We are a student's club focused on building the nation first attitude.
          We work on knowledge synthesis and personality building by developing a platform for discussing issues of national importance.
          We also network with the corporate sector and academia to channel knowledge to our members.
          We believe that being students of institutions like NIT Rourkela where the government spends so much on us, it is our greater responsibility to contribute towards the development of the nation.
          We at Think India NIT Rourkela, work towards developing knowledge and awareness about India among young students.
          We organize talks, debates, workshops, and other events to channel knowledge to masses.
          We also support students by availing training and internship through our network in the corporate sector and academia.
