We are a network of students engaged in knowledge synthesis and personality building. For this purpose, we network with the corporate sector and academia.

We at Think India NIT Rourkela, work towards developing knowledge and awareness about India among young students. We organise talks, debates, workshops and other events to channel knowledge to masses. We support students by availing training and internship through our network in the corporate sector and academia.
